### üë®‚Äçüíª Development
Pins for hardware developement and debug will be added on the back of d3m0n phones in future versions

# Improvements in the future versions
- better battery time
- better specs
- front cam
- increased stability
- thinner and more aesthetic
- better performances (+RAM and better CPU) + OPTIMIZATION 

AND MAYBE OWN MOTHERBOARD MADE FROM SCRATCH using ARM micoprocessors

### Special thanks to vertydagenius for his help

# Examples of any other non factory made cellular phones
These are ugly, huge and super badly made compared to d3m0n phones </br>
